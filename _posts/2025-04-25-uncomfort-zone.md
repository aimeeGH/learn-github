title: "How I got comfy leaving my comfort zone"

What do planning a solo trip, learning a new language, pivoting careers, and asking someone out all have in common? They force me to confront what I know to be true and take a leap outside my comfort zone.

My philosophy towards life has always been to ‚Äútry shit and see what sticks.‚Äù I‚Äôd rather heal from the sting of disappointment than be left with the scars of regret. Because of this, I have had more than my fair share of bruises, cuts, and stings, but few have resulted in permanent marks or reminders.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, failure cuts deep, and rejection still stings. How have I developed tough skin? By channeling tools and strategies that make the uncomfortable more comfy.

### 1. Live for your future self
Take risks for the sake of making life easier for your future self.

So much of my life has been (and partially still is) defined by caring what others think. If I didn‚Äôt perform well on an exam, I feared the reaction of my teachers and parents more than the potential hit to my GPA (I now realize they were concerned cause I was concerned). I built my identity on what I thought others expected of me. When I finally left for college, I wasn‚Äôt completely sure what I wanted or who I was.

The one opinion that should be given the most weight in your decision-making is your future self. No one can understand your current situation better than the person who has had to live through all the decisions that led me to this moment: YOU.

My ideal life: It‚Äôs a Tuesday, I‚Äôm traveling to a random country with my significant other, eating new foods, and talking in local phrases I learned on the first-class plane ride here.

Since I‚Äôve spent so long daydreaming and manifesting my ideal future, you best believe I am hustling in my personal and professional life now. Or else, I‚Äôd fear disappointing the one person I‚Äôll have to live with for the rest of my life: FUTURE ME.

### 2. Reflect compassionately and constructively
How can I give myself some compassionate, yet constructive feedback?

For me, it was pivoting careers. I remember mulling over this decision for a while. It was vastly different from my college major, my internships, and I felt it was a betrayal of my past self, who had spent long nights studying theoretical stats classes and passing tough exams. Did it all go to waste?

Fast forward four months, and I am genuinely having a blast. The newness of my role makes it feel like I‚Äôm working in a startup environment, the mentorship has been incredible, and I can see the tangible results of my work. It‚Äôs also forced me outside my comfort zone of spreadsheets and calculations and into more public speaking and client-facing roles.

That‚Äôs not to say that my college degree and internships went to waste. Quite the opposite‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre the reasons I got my current job. The skillset I built in college and the constructive feedback I received during my internships made me an informed and well-rounded applicant.

Even if things were not going as well, I would still gift myself this kind of compassionate yet constructive analysis. Being direct yet kind to yourself is the best way to force and inspire yourself toward greatness.ü§©

### 3. Collect data as life happens
Collect your personal data before tech companies do.

Have you ever wondered if your phone is listening to you? Or how social media algorithms have gotten so good lately? It‚Äôs because all these apps are racing to collect your data from the moment you skimmed through and accepted their [pages-long Terms and Conditions](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/8hfdty/terms_and_conditions_of_different_apps_or_in/). (If you sat down to read this or have an AI summarize it for you, you‚Äôd be shocked at what you‚Äôre signing.)

Pretend you‚Äôre an app. What would your Terms and Conditions be? What data would you want to collect on yourself? It‚Äôs time to take a page out of Big Tech‚Äôs playbook: The key to curating the life you want and keeping you hooked on the app that is your life is to collect your own data.

Data is objective. Google knows (and probably tracks) how many times you stalked an ex, and DoorDash knows how many times you were too lazy to cook last week. The question is, do you?

Collecting data takes many forms ‚Äî journaling, taking photos, reviewing old credit card statements (painful yet necessary), tracking your sleep, etc. The key is synthesizing all of this data to create meaningful and objective insights on your current life. Why go through all this effort of putting myself outside my comfort zone if I do not have data on my limitations and strengths?

Take, for instance, old photo albums. These snapshots help me understand what mattered and what I considered picture-worthy at a certain time in my life. Back in high school, it was Snapchat dog-filter selfies and calculus homework. In college, it was R code, food pics, and LA sunsets. Now, it‚Äôs pictures from airplane windows and PowerPoint/Excel screenshots. When was I the most content? Open to interpretation.

What pictures do I want to be taking, in say, five years? Ten years? Your data holds immense predictive power. 

### in conclusion
If you didn't read Apple's Terms and Conditions, you probably didn't make it to the end of this article. But that's ok, I'll summarize for you. **tldr**: Live for your future self, Reflect constructively yet compassionately, Collect your personal data
